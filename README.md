# brothers-in-law
Two brother-in-law have planed for their vacation. Their family have small kids. They have agreed that each one who 
reaches any toll first will wait for the other. We will simulate this trip here.

## brotherInLaw
In this code we have two functions that each of them is assigned to a thread. In each function we have a loop that is 
the number of tolls. Also, we print the situation that each family is in.

## brotherInLawGUI
This is as same as last one but there is a difference that in here by tkinter we have a GUI and show the situations with
 picture of that family.
